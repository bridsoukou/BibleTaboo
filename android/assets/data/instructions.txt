Help your teammates guess as many words as possible before your time runs out without saying any of the words on the screen.
When your team guesses the word, press the green button. 
If you decide to skip the word or if you say one of the words on the screen, press the red button. Have a member of the other team watch the screen!
When the time runs out, it is the other team's turn to do the same thing.
The teams may want to choose a different "describer" each time.
