# BibleTaboo
A theocratic version of the board game Taboo, written in Java with LibGDX.

To start the game on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS (Requires JVM):

Run `runBibleTaboo.jar`

To edit the word list:

`android/assets/data/first100.txt`

Format:
```
@Guess Word

Forbidden Word

Forbidden Word

Forbidden Word

Forbidden Word
```

The current version only allows four forbidden words, but I plan to change this soon.
