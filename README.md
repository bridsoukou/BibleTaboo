# BibleTaboo
A theocratic version of the board game Taboo, written in Java with LibGDX.

To start game on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS (Requires JVM):
Locate and run desktop/builds/lib/desktop-1.0.jar

To edit the word list:
android/assets/data/first100.txt
Format:
@Guess Word
Forbidden Word
Forbidden Word
Forbidden Word
Forbidden Word

The current version only allows four forbidden words, but I plan to change this soon.
